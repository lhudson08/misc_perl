# misc_perl

Perl scripts that I haven't yet moved to another repo.

Each of the scripts _should_ work. 

Some are more useful than others.

## INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install

## SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

After installing, you can find documentation for the
scripts in ./bin with the perldoc command. 
For example, finding documentation on SCRIPT.pl:

    perldoc SCRIPT.pl
